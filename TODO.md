### TODO

- [x] swipe to dismiss: either left swipe or right swipe (dismiss the correct way) will be constant for all styles of modal
- [x] small screens: fill width of screen
- [x] see if you can work on the grow from link animation (as much like giene macOS)
  animation:
    scale window and move it towards link until invisible
    (reverse on open)
- [x] thickbox without tbAnim will use 'legacy' animation
- [x] see if its possible to make it emerge from the source `<a>` tag :check:
- [x] comment on CSS

### Notes

should we add tbAnimDuration to classes for custom open closing times?

```
style.css
thickbox.css
thickboxanimation.css
```
