# Modal code
This repo has some code for creating a modal (pop up) with javascript and the <dialog> element.

You can either run an express server to try out the ajax modals, or just open `public/index.html` in your browser to see the normal, local behaviour.

# Setup:

`git clone https://github.com/SamFeltip/Sams-Ajax-Modal.git`

`cd Sams-Ajax-Modal/`

`npm install`

`node server.js`
